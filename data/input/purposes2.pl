      Internal codebases are software we have written in order to
      further our aims to collect and integrate software and to solve
      problems that affect people using FLOSS software.  The most
      important tools to the most casual user will be
      Busroute/Gourmet, to the intermediate user with be Unilang and
      all its agents (Manager/Verber/PSE/...), and to the developer
      RADAR/Packager/Architect.  Most of the systems are 1st
      generation and will either evolve out of additions and
      integrations or be rewritten.  They are mostly written in OO
      Perl.  The more red text is, the newer it is.  The Arch gifs are
      of the actual code.

    Akahige
    
     -  
    Shoestring public health
    
      akahige  is a free medical assistant to be used when a physician is
    unavailable. 
 It will  contain  an expert  system for  diagnosing
    medical  problems. 
 In  this  way otherwise  unavailable  medical
    knowledge  may be  brought to  bear. 
 It  also makes  use  of folk
    medicinal  knowledge. 
 Together,  RSR/ gourmet / akahige   provide  a
    robust record  mechanism with  which to determine  empirically the
    effectiveness of various remedies (evidence-based medicine?). 
 The
    diagnosis  system immediately wraps  into an  execution component. 
 For instance  if someone is  in need of emergency  assistance like
    CPR,   akahige  provides  interactive instruction. 
 A large  set of
    SOPs and  COAs are  stored and if  interested or necessary  may be
    taught to people using  clear .

 It can  do  many simple
    things (often by using external programs), such as generate
    acronyms, generate rhymes, and select words by syntactic/semantic
    constraints.

    Code Monkey
    
     -     As a sign of the progress of our systems, we now have more or less
    a need for an "automated programmer" (or Debian maintainer). 
 This
    is because, much in the  same way that CMU\'s gaze estimator builds
    on  their  stable  platform  for Active  Appearance  Models  which
    accurately model  head position, we now have  a large architecture
    for manipulating and working on packages. 
 This allows us to mount
    a " code-monkey ",  i.e. gives  us the setting  in which  to develop
    tools which  can be  applied to improving  what already  exists in
    terms of  automated methods for dealing with  code. 
 Therefore the
     code-monkey  system is appropriate.

 It allows  the user to  categorize and

 At each  point the  system determines  on the

    items they have already seen, rate cached items they have not, and
    whether to retrieve more entries in specific categories.

     -  
    A temporary Goal/Interest/Ability system for group coordination
     In developing  job-search ,  it became  clear  that when  we wanted to
    model  the user\'s  skills,  clear   could only  model what  they had
    read, not  actually done. 
 And  one cannot claim  to know
    something  by simply  reading without  demonstrable  experience to
    verify their understanding. 
 The requirement for better modelling
    of the user\'s development experience  also ties in nicely with our
    recent  initiative towards project  internships. 
 So   fieldgoal  is
    again a planning  module that interfaces with a  growing number of
    systems -   architect ,  job-search ,  clear ,  meeting ,   verber , etc.  -

    FormalForum
     -  
    Advanced news and discussion forum
      formalforum  is a news summarization system that works as live
    intelligence feed / situational awareness system. 
 It uses various
    technologies, like collaborative filtering, classification, etc,
    to determine which stories it has collected from its sources the
    user would be interested in. 
 Ultimately we would like to
    integrate  reasonbase  as a backend.

    FRDCSAL
     -  
    FRDCSA Programming Language
      frdcsal   consists of  a  programming language  almost entirely  on
    natural  language. 
 The  system  grows as  it  tries to  interpret
    "programs" of the extension .ai. 
 The EBNF of the language is: 
 Text := sigma star
    Function := {Predicate} \'(\' {Text} \')\'
    Predicate := {Text} 
 The semantics are  almost those of natural language. 
 There is no
    central cohesion to  the semantics. 
 The executor is  written in a
    combination  of  frdcsal  and  Perl. 
 A  translation memory  is kept
    between   frdcsal    and  Perl,  and  whenever   the  system  cannot
    adequately  execute code,  it  asks the  programmer supervisor  to
    resolve the problem by  either deciding the case (through argument
    if necessary) or drafting more code to implement that. 
 Needless to say the code is, um, self-documenting, hehe. 
 The obvious application  is that as functionality is  added to the
    system, it will  be able to parse almost  arbitrary data to assist
    it in  its search. 
 The way in  which the executor  is developed,
    based on techniques for  interpretation rooted in the hard science
    of the programming  gives it its tremendous power. 
 .ai files can
    include Perl for simplicity.

      gourmet   is  the  belated  response to  Nikita  Khrushchev\'s  1959
    Kitchen Debate challenge: "Don\'t you have a machine that puts food
    into  the mouth  and pushes  it down?" 
 Well, not  quite,  but it
    doesn\'t  get any easier  than this. 
 It is  a very  user friendly
    system for  improving people\'s health and  nutrition. 
 It provides
    suggestions  and resources  for healthy  meals  non-invasively and
    without placing any  burden on the user. 
 It has  been shown to be
    able  to achieve  enormous  time (5x),  cost  (4x), nutrition  and
    palatability improvements, especially when using its advanced meal
    planning capabilities. 
 There  are numerous technical details that
    make  it  very useful,  especially  for  the  target audiences  of
    developing countries,  people of  all  nations  in poverty, computer
    users,  people with  obesity and  other medical  reasons,  such as
    allergies, kidney disease,  diabetes, etc.  Ironically,  gourmet  is
    often dismissed out of hand as  too hard to use, simply BECAUSE it
    is a meal planner.

 Each function to be  learned is
    given a name, (generally an  extension of the current perl module)
    so that the program need not specify storage files, etc.  The type
    of  learner  to be used is  passed as an argument, and then calls to
    the specific type of learning  functions may be used. 
 As a bonus,
     learner  attempts to automatically determine which  learner  is to be

     An  architecture for automatically  packaging codebases  for Linux
    packaging  systems, like  Debian\'s deb  format, RedHat\'s  rpm, and
    Slackware\'s tgz. 
 There are a  number of strategies that we use to
    enable  packager  to package codebases that have been discovered and
    retrieved  by   radar . 
 Up  until  now  we  have simply  hand-coded
    algorithms in OO Perl. 
 But obviously, once we find more organized
    methods,  these  will  gradually  replace  the  current  throwaway
    scripts. 
 For  example,  we  have  considered  is  writing  NPDDL
    planning domains. 
 A key feature is that  packager  is able to learn
    from the user  in order to increase the class  of codebases it can
    handle. 
 And,  just recently  we  have  considered that  existing
    packages, along  with their  original codebase sources,  provide a
    wealth  of information  that could  be  used as  input to  machine
    learning systems.

     -  
    Operations management real-time strategy system
     Problems need not  be complex. 
 Very often the  cause of a problem
    is  clear . 
  problemspace  is  a system that visualizes problems, and
    lets  problem-solving  tactitians  make  decisions  that  lead  to
    results for  everyone involved. 
  problemspace   is a C2  system for
    problem-solving  tacticians. 
 It   is  an  interface  to  augment
    analysts  with relevant  intelligence and  provide  Mutual Assured
    Security (MAS). 
 It provides roughly  a real time strategy view of
    executing operations, and also manages the planning of operations.

 Currently,  we are  working with  modelling
    these relationships with ActionPredicates in OpenCyc. 
 A different
    project  is responsible  for  automatically translating  sentences
    into   equivalent    cyc   representations   using    word   sense
    disambiguation,  as  well  as  machine  translation.

          RADAR   -  
    Rapid Application Discovery And Retrieval
      radar  is  a catch- all  system  for creating ontologies  of software
    systems  from web sources. 
 It is  responsible for  modelling the
    state   of  various  online   software,  and   uses  sophisticated
    heuristics for  retrieval. 
 Just as  an example, it  estimates the
    stability  (future availability)  of the  software  in determining
    whether to  retrieve it to ration storage  and bandwidth capacity,
    and uses  previous release timing to prioritize  link checking and
    reindexing  of already indexed  codebases. 
 It  has many  modes of
    operation (spidering, request brokering), and we have not yet been
    able to  come up with  a formal model  of these behaviours,  or to
    diagram  the architecture  effectively. 
 The  list of  features is
    also  very  extensive  and,  as  we   do  not  yet  have  a  working
    capabilities  management  system  at   time  of  writing,  is  not
    compiled. 
 Shortly,  we expect to list  its features automatically
    on the FRDCSA website.

    SamWise
     -  
    In a directory on a Debian system there lived a hobbit...
     So, what is seed AI? 
 Although seed AI suffers from a transitive
    closure violation unless one assumes a friendly environment, it is
    worth developing such a system to speed things up. 
 In other
    words, most programming that we are doing is declarative, there is
    no real inferencing done by the software. 
 Now, we want the system
    to  do  a lot of its own reasoning. 
 We don\'t need it to think so
    intelligently that it can reason with absolute precision about
    certain problems - in fact, the quid pro quo error of mathematics
    is that very often something that is rejected as not being a
    solution may have 100 % of the solution. 
 When this is desirable
    is another constraint. 
 So, the same type of thinking is necessary
    here. 
 What we want out of it is introspection and a novel amount
    of reasoning, but mainly, independence, gallant behaviour etc.  We
    would like it to solve its own problems, to get bored and switch
    to others. 
 Mostly, to seek out answers to problems and fixes. 
 The large mechanisms for perception are readily available through
    our comprehensive perl bindings. 
 But the ability to think and
    act, not as an adult (lifting A.I. by its brooches so to speak),
    nor precisely emulating biological cognitive structure, nor a
    tediously exact code implementation. 
 No, it should be a complex
    little cognitive architecture, with a visual buffer,
    communication, etc.  No draconian formalisms here. 
 No exactly
    replication of behaviour. 
 But a  seeker  of knowledge. 
 Definitely
    like PIC in its complexity but not as exact... 
 It can get stuff
    done because, although in exact, it is not open ended like
    ConceptNet, but self contained, constituting of most flavors of
    cognitive systems theory without much to go. 
 Kind of a hobbit.

    Contingency planning, crisis management
     Traditionally,  planning systems  are   all  about  finding ways  to
    solve  the combinatoric problem  of satisfying  a few  goals. 
 Why
    these goals are selected is  not usually of any consequence. 
 What
    we really need  is a system that understands  what happens if, for
    instance, you   do  not  pay your rent. 
 Another thing, is  that it
    make sure  that the daily  average of some required  thing exceeds
    what it  needs to be, hence  ensuring that you  don\'t fall behind. 
 So,  our  system  is  for  instance  able to  reason  as  to  what
    consequences will happen if certain actions are taken or forsaken,
    and on the  basis of this, determine what  it thinks are important
    goals. 
 Involve some kind  of automatic relational multidimensional queue. 
 Ensure that it looks at everything (completeness). 
 A planner that
    looks  at   all   possible  actions,  and calculates  what  is  most
    effective for you to  do .

      Minor codebases are internal software we have written which are
      not general enough to belong to internal codebases, and which
      solves a specific problem.  Several minor codebases are
      subsystems of internal codebases and have been developed
      separately for ease of development, but will probably be
      integrated eventually.  The more red text is, the newer it is.

 This umbrella project serves to get a toy
    implementation of this architecture functioning. 
 This consists of
    having the list of desired capabilities, executing searches for
    systems having the capabilities (using tools like radar-web-search
    and software-recommender), generates a priority queue of software
    to obtain. 
 It will iterate over the queue, downloading the
    systems with RADAR and packaging them with Packager. 
 It then
    performs many administrative tasks wrt the new  system  - including
    the Application phase of  csa , through Architect.

 So this  system  does it automatically. 
 There is a dataset for event extraction but it is brittle. 
 There

     There are several systems in existence which are able to process
    text and extract facts. 
 In general, on can think of breaking a
    text down into straightforward, small axiomatic assertions. 
 So it
    is indeed related to natural language to logic conversion. 
 But
    this methodology does not require to go the full way, for this it
    is sufficient to break it up into actionable facts.

    by the contents of the source text. 
 As one might guess, it is
    context sensitive. 
 Such a tool is useful in applications such as
    determining if UniLang entries are redundant. 
 This capability is
    also useful in many other applications, and is closely related to

 Therefore,
    the Apertium engine was used to translate the static website into

 However, it will work with other
    translation systems and so soon we will release translations to
    many as many other languages as we can.

     -  
    Proposal for an American Hacklab Infolab
    
     Problem: Corporate Media, owned by just a few companies, has a
      monopoly on the ideas that are force fed to "consumers". 
 Likewise,
      corporations to a large extent control the computer operating systems. 
 The internet, however, has seen the production of many documentaries,
      documentation, and operating systems which offer different and
      important viewpoints. 
 Many of these documentaries and operating
      systems are licensed with free redistribution, and can be distributed
      via DVD. 
 The goal of the American Hacklab  infolab  project is to create, in the
      tradition of European hacklabs (but without the physical space
      requirements), Infolabs that can help with the distribution of
      materials.

 This  system  attempts to derive relations
    automatically. 
 Such relations are explicitly marked as having
    such a derivation. 
 The most obvious relation is the depends
    relation.

    which goals depend on or predepend for other goals.

 If we had a database of such tasks,

    Message Classifier

    Classify UniLang messages according to intent
    
     This is a subsystem of Corpus (that is related to Critic) that
    attempts to apply various strategies to determine how a UniLang
    message should be classified. 
 UniLang sends Corpus the log
    database entry id of a message, and corpus should respond with a
    set of prescribed actions. 
 One strategy is to use classifications
    proposed by the user. 
 The annotations are created through one of
    several interfaces (a Critic script and the Critic FreeKBS
    interface). 
 Another strategy is to apply  sayer  to the message to
    obtain semantic information about it, and use that context to
    derive the desired results. 
 Another strategy being looked at is
    to group entries together based on approximate lexical patterns.

    Nooks and Crevices
    
     -  
    Identify areas of the project that have sat dormant for a while
    
     Nooks and Crevices uses Elog data about which files are being
    visited to calculate which files and directories of the FRDCSA
    have not been attended to recently. 
 The thought is that often
    times we lose sight of the big picture and the very tasks we are
    attempting to resolve have been either partially or wholly
    completed elsewhere in the project (as has happened many times,
    just look at " todo-systems "). 
 By allowing us to look at the areas
    of the project that have been dormant for a while, hopefully we
    will distill a larger picture of the purpose of the project and
    relearn aspects of the project.

     This is probably the silliest, smallest possible application, but
    I just find it fun. 
 The goal is to learn to assign flags to text
    descriptions of capabilities (and I guess vice versa to some
    extent - you want to make sure you don\'t use something that is
    better suited for something else.... 
 In other words, it is able
    to assign command line options to a description of that option,

     There are many useful functions and classes in many programming
    languages. 
 The goal of this project is to analyze the existing

 This strategy is complemented by efforts to run other

    Search FTP sites for interesting artifacts and catalogue
    
     While the FRDCSA has a ridiculous number of projects ongoing at any
time, a recently developing project has taken my fancy because it
promises to offer good dividends. 
 The project, called "Raiders of the
FTP Sites", well, speaks for itself. 
 It is a  system  that searches FTP
sites for interesting artifacts and retrieves them. 
 It works by
correlating subject matter of interest with FTP sites, extracting a
recursive directory listing of the FTP site, and then performing
several analyzes of the contents. 
 While still a very immature  system ,
it has yielded up a labelled resume corpus which will help the
job-search program.

    Reading Analyzer

    Determine the intellectual caliber of a text
    
     It is a theory of mine that linguistic expressitivity supervenes
    on thought. 
 How can one reason with something if they cannot even
    precisely state it? 
 This  system  is geared at determining the
    intellectual caliber of a text. 
 It will assist then in locating
    similar texts. 
 It works with ALL to teach the user concepts in
    the text they don\'t already know (provided it can know them
    through some means). 
 It works with  sayer  and  thinker  otherwise.

    Recovery-FRDCSA
    
     -  
    Reassemble lost parts of the FRDCSA
    
     At one point in the history of the project, the main FRDCSA  system 
    was destroyed. 
 All that was left of it was one partial backup on
    a remote site. 
 As you can tell, lots was lost. 
 But, echoed
    throughout that backup were some projections of parts of the data. 
 For instance, many capabilities were listed on the webpages. 
 This
    enabled the reconstruction of various parts of the project. 
 Though several years of UniLang messages were sadly lost, many
    years were restored through such files. 
 They were recently
    reloaded into UniLang, enabling the regeneration of the FRDCSA
    static web sites.

    Sayer
    
     -  
    Cognitive system that analyzes data structures for meaning
    
      sayer  gets its name because it builds a context by asserting
    interesting facts about arbitrary Perl data structures. 
  sayer 
    (along with  thinker ) is one of the most interesting projects of
    the FRDCSA. 
 What it does is index arbitrary perl data structures,
    and attempt to derive interesting information and conclusions
    about that data using machine learning. 
 For instance, if your
    data structure consisted of a string, and that string contained a
    paragraph of text,  sayer  would apply a decision tree or similar,
    set of tests, to determine that it indeed was as we described. 
 It
    would represent this relation as a graph, with verticies as
    data-points, I.e. the input, and "true", and edges as function
    calls. 
 All data of course is stored to a database. 
 This graph
    data is then used as input to classifiers that attempt to distill
    summarily interesting information about said data. 
 For instance,
    if it is a sentence, it may well wish to perform various NLP
    procedures, extracting things like named entities, and recursively
    analyzing those within it\'s attention span. 
 It uses Perl as
    knowledge representation interlingua. 
 The architecture is
    expansive, complex, and beautiful and integrates many other FRDCSA
    systems.

    Todo Systems
    
     -  
    A collection of initial attempts at various aspects of todo systems
    
     The FRDCSA has a long and glorious history of incomplete todo  system 
    implementations. 
 To wit: Score, Do, Lightspeed,
    Normal-Form/Spark, Todo, PSE, Agenda,  system -Planning, and
     task-manager , to name a few. 
 It is a tough domain. 
 (Fortunately,
    recent work on FreeKBS has enabled the creation of a set of tools
    for efficiently working with goals.) 
 Additionally, each  system 
    catered towards a different aspect of the so-called executive
    skills. 
 This  system  therefore is part of the FRDCSA research into
    cognitive prosthetics. 
 This  system  aims to integrate all these
    aspects into a new  system  with superior capabilities - that will
    definitively secure the solution to this challenging domain, at
    least enough of a solution to keep us on track to achieve the
    final product. 
 It has been rather successful lately in helping
