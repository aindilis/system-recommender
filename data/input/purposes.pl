NetOwl Extractor combines dynamic recognition with static look-up to achieve high accuracy and coverage at very high speed. NetOwl Extractor is based on advanced computational linguistic and natural language processing technology. By intelligently analyzing structure and context within text, NetOwl accurately identifies key information.',
